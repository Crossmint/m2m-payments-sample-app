/*
 * The three example brands the sample app can wear. A brand is a set of
 * theme tokens (colors, radius, type) applied through `data-brand` on a
 * wrapper element; every component below it follows, because the UI kit
 * only ever reads tokens. The values live in `app/globals.css`.
 *
 * "acme" is the default and the tokens in `packages/ui/src/styles.css`.
 * "nova" is dark with a lime accent and full-round corners. "maple" is warm
 * and editorial, with a serif display face and square corners.
